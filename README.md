# California_Housing_Dataset from Kaggle
About Dataset
Context:

This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.
The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.
Content:
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:
longitude,latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value,ocean_proximity.
Features:- 1.Nominal Features: ocean_proximity (categorical feature indicating the proximity to the ocean). 2.Ordinal Features: None. 3.Discrete Features: total_rooms,total_bedrooms,households.[Discrete data is made up of discrete or distinct values.] 4.Continuous Features: longitude, latitude, median_income, median_house_value.[Continuous data includes any value that falls inside a range.]
